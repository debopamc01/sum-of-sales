# Minimal Sales Summary Web App

This is a minimal single-page web application that fetches data in CSV format, sums the 'sales' column, and displays the total with a Bootstrap 5 styling.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your web browser to see the app in action.

The data is simulated as an embedded string in the script section of `index.html`. Replace `dataCSV` content with your actual CSV data if needed.

## Note

This example uses a hardcoded CSV string. In a real scenario, you might fetch `data.csv` from a server or local attachment.
